                  enabled, and may be changed or removed without notice. ManagementPolicy
                  specifies the level of control Crossplane has over the managed external
                  resource. This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field
                  in a future release. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and non-default values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled.
